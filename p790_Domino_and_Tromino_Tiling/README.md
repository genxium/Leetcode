A more difficult version of this problems will be like
```
Given K different shapes of tiles, e.g. an "L", a "2-bar", a "3-bar", a "star", each with infinite supplies, find how many ways there're to fill a MxN board. What about with finite supplies "tileLimit[i], 0 <= i < K"? 
```

The "infinite supply" version can be solved by converting to the [ExactCover problem](https://www.yinxiang.com/everhub/note/e71e7e87-ca06-40e5-a880-c9517a9afd33).
