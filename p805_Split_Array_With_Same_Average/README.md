The `dpBySumAsState` approach is a classical approach to the famous [UVA "Tug of War" problem](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=973), which is a more difficult version of [p416_Partition_Equal_Subset_Sum](https://github.com/genxium/Leetcode/tree/master/p416_Partition_Equal_Subset_Sum) and [p1755_Closest_Subsequence_Sum](https://github.com/genxium/Leetcode/tree/master/p1755_Closest_Subsequence_Sum).
