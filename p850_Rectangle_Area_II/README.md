The "SegmentTree" solution here might look a bit unfamiliar to some, please read [this note](https://www.yinxiang.com/everhub/note/b904af18-03fd-4dbc-a3d2-67a0daa1518e) and checkout [p307_Range_Sum_Query_Mutable](https://github.com/genxium/Leetcode/tree/master/p307_Range_Sum_Query_Mutable) beforehand to get more comfortable about it.

See [p391_Perfect_Rectangle](https://github.com/genxium/Leetcode/tree/master/p391_Perfect_Rectangle) for a more compact version that maintains the same `fullCoverAccDiff` and `activeBottomLengthSum` with a single `RangeAdd` method.
