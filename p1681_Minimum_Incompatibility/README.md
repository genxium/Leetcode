Like [ZumaGame](https://github.com/genxium/Leetcode/tree/master/p488_Zuma_Game), intuitively we propose a "StateTuple = (set<int> alreadyUsed, set<int> activeSubsetAtHand, set<int> candidates)" to uniquely represent the game state at any instant, where in this problem each can be uniquely identified by a 16-bit integer. It's obvious that "alreadyUsed + activeSubsetAtHand + candidates == (1 << n) - 1", thus merely 2 of the 3 params are enough to identify the "StateTuple".
