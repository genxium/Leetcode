# Maximize/minimize "f(inputs)" by K times of using "operation(...)" on "inputs"

For the less difficult ones of these problems, they may have an "optimal substructure", e.g. "f(inputs)[k] = max{ operation(f(inputs)[j]) | j <= k-1 }", to exploit and we can just iterate K times to get the answer.

For the more difficult ones of these problems, they often don't have an "optimal substructure", or exploiting the "optimal substructure" isn't fast enough, hence demanding us to derive a "greedy step for current state".

For some peculiar ones where K is very small but neither an "optimal substructure" nor an obvious "greedy step for current state" is available, we can just search exhaustively.
